#  Public Officials on Social Media

I study politicians and public officials on social media in order to answer questions about the impact of social media on democracy and policy. I'm especially interested in the U.S. and Global South contexts, and most of my work to date has studied the U.S. Congress.

Data sources in this project include many different aspects of politicians' public life, including their
- public statements on social media platforms (e.g., tweets, Facebook posts)
- voting records
- fundraising efforts and donations received

The project uses only public data and focuses on the politicians (not their constituents or private citizens).
