# About Me

 Social media has some very real toxicity challenges, like harassment and cyberbullying, that diminish its utility for collective and democratic efforts, and I study human-AI content moderation to address those challenges ([NSF Grant](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928434&HistoricalAwards=false), [Belfer Fellowship](https://www.adl.org/belfer-fellows), [Mozilla Grant](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/07/11/mozilla-funds-top-research-projects/), [Nayar Prize](https://web.iit.edu/nayar-prize/finalists/teams/cyberbullying-early-warning-and-response-system)). I also study data curation, especially how we evaluate (a) the impacts of data reuse and (b) investments in curating and disseminating research data. My work has been funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?PIId=&PIFirstName=libby&PILastName=hemphill&IncludeCoPI=true&BooleanElement=All&BooleanRef=All&ActiveAwards=true&ExpiredAwards=true), the [Institute for Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-37-19-0134-19), the [Nayar Prize](https://web.iit.edu/nayar-prize/finalists/teams/cyberbullying-early-warning-and-response-system), [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/07/11/mozilla-funds-top-research-projects/), the [Anti-Defamation League](https://www.adl.org/belfer-fellows), Amazon, and DiscoverText. 

I have a few titles at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu):

* Associate Professor, [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/)
* Research Associate Professor, [Institute for Social Research](http://home.isr.umich.edu/)
* Associate Professor, [Digital Studies Institute](https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/), [College of Literature, Science, and the Arts](https://lsa.umich.edu/)

* Director, [Resource Center for Minority Data](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/RCMD), [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
* Director, [Social Media Archive](http://socialmediaarchive.org), [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
* Associate Director, [Center for Social Media Research](https://csmr.umich.edu/)

# Work with Me

Thank you for your interest! I'm not recruiting students or postdocs right now. 

<!--
## Post Docs

I am a faculty mentor in the [2021 Michigan Data Science Fellows Program](https://midas.umich.edu/2021-fellows/). It's a two-year program, and a fellow who works with me with have a co-mentor in UMSI and join research communities in the [Institute for Research on Women and Gender](https://irwg.umich.edu/) and/or [Digital Studies Institute](https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/).

I'm looking for someone interested in using computational approaches to understand social media experiences of historically marginalized populations. For instance, projects in this space grow from seeds like: what's the difference in viewership and promotion for fashion YouTubers of different races? What rates of content deletion do women and nonbinary folks face compared to men on Reddit? How do the demographics of the labelers influence supervised machine learning models for toxicty detection?

Candidates and mentors must apply jointly by *April 23*. [Email me](mailto:libbyh@umich.edu) by *March 31* if you're interested in applying together.


## PhD Students

I'm not sure whether I'm recruiting PhD students for fall 2023. Check out some of my research, and contact me if you're interested.

PhD students will be admitted through the [School of Information](https://beta.si.umich.edu/programs/phd-information); applications are __[due December 1](https://beta.si.umich.edu/programs/phd-information/how-do-i-apply)__. Here are some of the questions I'm working on:
* How should we structure archives of dynamic social media data?
* How can data recommender systems impact research data reuse?
* How can we make social media content moderation systems more productive and inclusive?

I'm especially interested in students who are curious about the impact of social media on democracy and civic engagement and how we can use computation and automation to make conversations and participation (in politics, in science, in society) more _just_ and _accessible_. You should have _stats_ and _computational expertise_ or be willing to gain some quickly. You should also have expertise or a strong interest in _political science_, _critical race and feminism studies_, and/or _communication_. 


## Undergraduates

I welcome undergrads in my research group! Right now, the best way to get involved is through [the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop/students/fall-winter-programs.html) at Michigan. I'll start interviewing for Fall/Winter on September 11, 2019. This year's project is called "Using Machine Learning and Experiments to Detect and Address Extremism": 

Extremist groups are especially adept at hiding in plain sight by using language that differs only slightly from acceptable speech (e.g., "blame on both sides") or employing thinly-veiled phrases that mask nefarious intent (e.g., "preserve our culture"). The subtleties of white supremacist language, especially, are not effectively captured by existing computational approaches to detecting and addressing it online. This project attempts to address this challenge by building an adaptive language model to detect white supremacist speech online. We will build machine learning models that can detect extremist speech and its changes (either over time or from innocuous speech) and create an API to help partners and users rate content they encounter.
